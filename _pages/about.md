I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Dr. Sam Coogan and Dr. Magnus Egerstedt. My research is in the area of multi-robot systems and controls with a focus on coverage control algorithms for a team of heterogeneous robots with various constraints. I pursue full-stack multi-robot system development from algorithm designs to hardware implementations.
